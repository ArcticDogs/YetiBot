Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the universe. But this… does put a smile on my face.
When I’m done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
You’re strong. But I could snap my fingers, and you’d all cease to exist.
The end is near.
I know what it’s like to lose. To feel so desperately that you’re right, yet to fail nonetheless. Dread it. Run from it. Destiny still arrives. Or should I say, I have.
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
